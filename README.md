# Dropdown Module Setup

This project organizes TypeScript code into logical modules for a structured, maintainable setup.

## Features

- **Modular Structure**: All code is split into separate modules within dedicated folders.
- **Type Definitions**: Custom types are organized in a separate folder, enhancing reusability and maintainability.
- **Main Entry Point**: All modules are imported into the main `main.ts` file. Dependencies between modules are managed with direct imports where needed.
- **Typed Functions**: All functions are fully typed to ensure reliable code with minimal errors.

## Project Structure

- `src/modules`: Contains all functional modules, such as `dropdown.ts`.
- `src/types`: Includes files with type definitions.
- `src/main.ts`: Imports and initializes all modules.

This setup provides a well-organized codebase, allowing easy navigation and future expansion.
